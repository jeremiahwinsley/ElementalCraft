# ElementalCraft

ElementalCraft is a magic mod based around the 4 elements: fire, water, earth and air.

 

You first need to find sources of theseelements and use an extractor to exploit them. First for crafting with infusion and binding, then you will use it to power shrines. Shrines can have a powerful impact on the world around them from crop growth to lava generation.

 

This project is still in early development stage, a lot of features are subject to change. It is meant to be played in modpacks and try to use as much as possible features like datapack (Tags and recipes) and forge config.
